/* -- i18n glue -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * GJS's native gettext module (the gi://Gettext typelib is gone from
 * modern GJS). The shell process and the prefs process each call
 * initI18n() once -- extension UUID + extension dir -- before any UI is
 * built. Until then, and whenever no catalog exists for the user's
 * locale, gettext() hands back the English msgid, so the extension
 * degrades to English instead of breaking.
 *
 * Catalogs live at  <ext>/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/<uuid>.mo  -- built
 * from po/*.po by tools/i18n-build.sh (xgettext -> msgmerge -> msgfmt).
 * New languages: add a line to po/LINGUAS + a po/<lang>.po.
